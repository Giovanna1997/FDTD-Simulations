# FDTD-Simulations
Finite-Difference Time-Domain Simulations of Electromagnetic Waves in 2D between different media

In this repository, we will implement a finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) method and simulate the behavior of electromagnetic waves at interfaces between dielectric media and scattering on perfectly electrically conducting (PEC) surfaces.
